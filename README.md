# onlyflips:  flipbooks for tips @  https://github.com/truesoulcoder/onlyflips

# 🎯 Goals & Principles
    - Premium polish: smooth micro-interactions, subtle shadows, refined typography, swipe delight
    - Modular & scalable: decoupled features, clear boundaries (flip engine, editor, storage, auth).
    - Serverless & lean: Next.js + Vercel at the edge, Supabase for data & assets—no ops overhead.
    - UX-first: mobile-friendly, accessible (ARIA, keyboard), performance-tuned.
    - Sprint 0: Foundation & Design (2 weeks)

# ✅ Design system & prototype in Figma
    - Color palette, type scale, Hero UI component variants, brand tokens.
    - Key screens: onboarding, project dashboard, editor canvas, settings panel, export flow.

# ✅ Repo & infra setup
    - Next.js 14 (App Router) boilerplate on Vercel, Tailwind + Hero UI configured.
    - Supabase project with flipbooks bucket + Postgres schema for books, pages, users.

# ✅ CI/CD pipeline
    - GitHub → Vercel auto-deploy, linting (ESLint), formatting (Prettier), basic Jest config.

##    Sprint 1: Core Flip Canvas & File I/O (2 weeks)
    - Flip Canvas Component
    - <FlipCanvas> wrapping StPageFlip (page-flip) or react-pageflip.
    - Responsive sizing, mobile/tablet viewport toggle, touch/swipe support.  
    - File Import Pipeline
    - Images: drag-drop & file picker, preview thumbnails, upload to Supabase Storage.
    - PDFs: client-side slicing via PDF.js → render canvases → upload pages.
    - Page CRUD
    - Append, remove, replace pages in both flip engine & Supabase metadata.
    - Zustand store for in-memory page list + syncing to Postgres.

##    Sprint 2: Editor UI & Page Management (2 weeks)
    - Thumbnail Strip
    - Hero UI list of thumbnails, drag-and-drop reorder (react-beautiful-dnd).
    - Inline “delete,” “duplicate,” “insert blank” controls.
    - Page Settings Panel
    - Dialog (Hero UI) with controls: cover type (hard/soft), shadow depth slider, flip speed.
    - Live-update flip canvas on change.
    - Metadata & TOC 
    - Allow per-page titles/chapters, auto-generate TOC view.
    - Persist to Supabase Postgres; fetch on editor load.

##    Sprint 3: Annotations, Preview Modes & Export (2 weeks)
    - Annotations Layer
    - Overlay Konva stage for freehand drawing, sticky notes, image cropping.
    - Toggle annotation mode; save annotation data in Postgres.
    - Preview Modes
    - “Live read” mode: full-screen flip only.
    - “Edit” mode: canvas + sidebar.
    - Export & Publishing
    - Bundle pages + metadata into a ZIP or static folder.
    - Vercel Function or Supabase Edge Function to generate public flipbook deployment.
    - Copy-paste embed snippet with <iframe> pointing to the hosted reader.

##    Sprint 4: QA, Performance & Polish (2 weeks)
    - Accessibility & Responsiveness
    - Keyboard nav for flipping, screen-reader labels, responsive touch zones.
    - Performance Tuning
    - Lazy-load pages, pre-fetch neighbors, compress images via Vercel Image Optimization
    - Micro-interactions & Animations
    - Subtle hover states, button ripples (Hero UI), loading skeletons for pages.
    - Beta Testing & Feedback Loop
    - Invite a small group of users, collect bug reports, iterate quick fixes.
    - Analytics & Monitoring
    - Integrate Sentry for error tracking, Vercel Analytics for usage patterns.

## 🚀 Launch & Beyond
    - Public beta → 1.0: finalize docs, sample comics, marketing site with demo.
    - Pro features: multi-user collaboration, embed custom branding, PDF export.
    - Growth: partner with indie comic creators, gather feedback, refine UX.

## 🎉 Why This Works  ##
    - Sprint cadence keeps momentum and visible progress.
    - Design-first ensures your app looks “premium” not “homebrew.”
    - Modularity lets you swap bits (e.g. flip engine) if you discover a better library later.
    - Serverless means zero ops—your focus stays on code and UX.
